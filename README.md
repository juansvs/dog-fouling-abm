# Dog Fouling and Parasite Risk in a Public Park
An agent-based model (ABM) which simulates the spatial and temporal accumulation of dog faeces and associated parasite contamination (specifically Toxocara canis) within a public park. It focuses on how dog-owner behaviour and park structure interact to create spatial heterogeneity in T. canis exposure risk.
